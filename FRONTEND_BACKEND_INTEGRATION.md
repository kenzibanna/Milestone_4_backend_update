## How to Test

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your frontend:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/` (served by backend)
   - Or open `index.html` directly in browser

3. **Test Booking:**
   - Go to "Book Now" page
   - Select a doctor (loaded from API)
   - Select time (from doctor's available times)
   - Fill in patient information
   - Check "create clinic history" to create account
   - Submit booking

4. **Test Patient History:**
   - Go to "Patient History" page
   - Login with credentials created during booking
   - View your appointment history

5. **Test Emergency:**
   - Go to "Emergency" page
   - Fill in emergency form
   - Submit emergency request

## Features

✅ **Real-time Data** - All data comes from MongoDB database
✅ **User Authentication** - Secure login system with JWT tokens
✅ **Patient Accounts** - Create account during booking
✅ **Appointment History** - View past appointments
✅ **Dynamic Content** - Doctors and services loaded from API
✅ **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages

## Next Steps

1. **Test all features** - Try booking, viewing history, emergency requests
2. **Customize styling** - Adjust CSS if needed for API-loaded content
3. **Add more features** - Consider adding appointment cancellation, rescheduling
4. **Deploy** - When ready, deploy backend to a cloud service (Heroku, Railway, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS errors**: Backend has CORS enabled, should work fine
- **API not responding**: Make sure backend server is running on port 3000
- **Doctors not loading**: Check browser console for errors, verify API endpoint
- **Login not working**: Check if user was created during booking, verify credentials

## Notes

- All API calls use `http://localhost:3000/api` - update this if deploying
- Authentication tokens are stored in localStorage
- Patient accounts are created with email format: `username@smileclinic.com`
- Emergency appointments are automatically assigned to first available doctor

Your dental clinic application is now fully functional with a connected backend! 🎉
